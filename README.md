#### Figure 1. The performance of AdaDP, DPSGD, the algorithm proposed in [Lee and Kifer, 2018] and the algorithm proposed in [Koskela, 2018] under high privacy level setting (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\epsilon=0.5" />). The noise level <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sigma" /> is set to 8.0 and the lot size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L" /> is set to 600.

#### Figure 2. The performance of AdaDP, DPSGD  high privacy level setting. The noise level <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sigma" /> is set to 8.0 and the lot size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L" /> is set to 600.
